# üåà Bifrost

**Bifrost** is a lightweight, configurable link picker for Linux desktops.

When set as your default browser, Bifrost intercepts link clicks and displays a selection screen where you can quickly choose **which browser** to open the link with.

Inspired by the Norse "Bifrost bridge" ‚Äî connecting worlds ‚Äî Bifrost connects your clicks to the browser you want.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Bifrost looks for a config file at:

`$HOME/.config/bifrost/bifrost.toml`


If not found, Bifrost uses built-in defaults.

You can create your own `bifrost.toml` to customize:

- Browser list (icons, executable commands)
- Theme colors (background, text, highlight)

Example `bifrost.toml`:

```
[colors]
background = "#2E3440CC"
text = "#ECEFF4FF"
highlight = "#5E81ACAA"

[[browsers]]
name = "Firefox"
exec = "firefox"
icon = "assets/firefox.png"

[[browsers]]
name = "Brave"
exec = "brave"
icon = "assets/brave.png"
```
